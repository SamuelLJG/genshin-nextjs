    "story": "Following her master's guidance, the girl ventured northward, traversing the freezing wastelands and the corridor of fractured mirrors at the edge of the frozen sea.\nAfter slaying countless monsters that wandered the ruins, finally, among the Abyssal remnants, she caught a glimpse of treasure concealed beneath drifting snow.\n\nYet she was not the first outsider to set foot here, for long before the scions of the far north had woven their sweet dream of submergence,\nA voyager, whose sentient will traversed the cosmos, once made a vow of reunion with a lord of dragons who had yet to fall into darkness.\n\nThis passerby was a scribe drifting through the vast void, duty-bound never to commune with primordial civilizations.\nAs her undying body slumbered away within a distant celestial disk-construct, her mind had drifted through an empty expanse spanning many light years,\nCharting countless peoples and civilizations fated to perish, pondering the ultimate truths of the cosmos in that eternal darkness.\nUntil a faint glimmer pierced her awareness, jolting the voyager from tenfold millennia of meditation.\n\nIt came from an unremarkable little world at the edge of the spiral arm — and from the primeval dragon that had been born alongside that world.\nThough death would one day bring an endless night, and the sun it gazed upon was but a fleeting ember,\nThis will, bound though it was to its planetary crust, shone more brilliantly than all the civilizations the voyager had ever seen.\nUnable to suppress the wonder and sorrow welling up from within, she delivered a solemn pronouncement unto its ruler:\n\n\"I have seen the lightless end, tearing through star clusters like a spindle among silken threads.\"\n\"I have seen how the cold tide of chaos drowns out all songs, so that good and evil alike vanish into silence.\"\n\"And yet, my kind, gentle king, will you still refuse to abandon your people?\"\n\"Forsake this world, fated for ruin, and journey with me beyond the stars.\"\n\nYet thus did the proud dragon reply:\n\"O friend from a distant world, I thank you for imparting these truths from beyond the skies.\"\n\"But though in your eyes they may seem ignorant creatures, to me, they are the very meaning of this universe.\"\n\"If the tide of oblivion must come, then let my bones be the bulwark that shields this realm.\"\n\"Bear witness to the path I have chosen, for I shall lead my people onward to the stars.\"\n\nBut when the voyager returned once more, the world she remembered had been utterly changed.\nThe bones of the earth had been bound beneath fourfold shackles, and the soft white radiance of the sky had been split into seven immutable hues.\nLike drifting smoke had the lord of dragons vanished, and the Winged One's throne now ruled the radiance of the three moons.\n\nBewildered by the dragon's unannounced departure, yet unwilling to disturb the world's new ruler,\nThe voyager, defying the laws of her kin, quietly cast her mind into the world inside the shell.\nVesting her consciousness in the body of a youth, she walked among these chordate animals,\nListening to their fervent and ever-escalating debates in this city of gold..."

Turning to forbidden methods, artisans forged countless fae spirits upon the bones of giant beasts.\nHaving spun fallen frostmoon light into flawless flesh and blood, they clad it to forms once frail and weak.\nSuch authority to create was once the lord of the firmament's divine prerogative, yet it was handed to mortals by the rebellious envoy,\nWho dreamed that one day, these little creatures might create a perfect being that could merge with the world.\n\nWithin the deep galleries, which still stood intact, the first angel whispered sweet dreams of the coming dawn to her companion:\n\"I see a time when the earthly nations will yearn no longer for heavenly mercy.\"\n\"The cities they build will rise up to the clouds, higher even than the throne and the stars.\"\n\"I see humans sharing the vast sky with the gods they once revered.\"\n\"There will be no more tears, sorrow, or death, for all will be complete.\"\n\nYet in the end, such wild delusions and ambitions were brought down from the heavens, and with them fell deep blue crystal spikes.\nThe fae shrieked as they turned into icy silver mist, and in the space of a single night, the splendor of the golden city was ruined by frost-laden winds.\nThe traitorous envoy was stripped of both name and form, and from that moment onward, a curse fell upon her kin:\nIf they dared gaze into another's eyes, and to one alone offer the love that was meant for all,\nThen not only would their divine beauty crumble into the wind, but their minds would fall to dust,\nUntil from the fallen one's remains a Seelie would rise, forever drifting in search of fading memories to consume."

If the laws are perfect and flawless, why fear the act of inquiry?\"\n\nIt was merely a boy of humble birth who, having somehow slipped past the watchful guards, had stepped into the chamber where the priests had convened.\nAll of their scholarly accusations he refuted in turn, their charges of heresy reduced to naught but angry, speechless glares.\nIn that silent chamber, the chief priest who wore the white-branched crown finally dismissed the guards who had rushed in.\n\n\"O heretical speaker — if, as your eloquent words would suggest, you truly hold that grievous sin is but the delusion of mere mortals...\"\n\"...Then let you be the one to drink from this cup of burning wrath. Go to the ashen-silver tree and plead your case before the very envoys who have cast judgment upon us.\"\n\nAnd so, the previously unknown youth ventured forth into the deepest recesses of the earth, seeking answers from the first angel..."

Let us recast these absurd laws with bone, and nourish the barren north with blood.\"\n\"Let us build a city and a tower that soars up to the clouds, that the people of the earth need weep bitter tears no longer.\"\n\"I cast this useless crown into the dust, that all earthly nations may breathe free of their shackles.\""
