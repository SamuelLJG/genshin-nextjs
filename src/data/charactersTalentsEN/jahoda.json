    "descriptionRaw": "Jahoda dashes toward her opponent, entering the Shadow Pursuit state upon contact. While in this state, Jahoda moves continuously and swiftly: If nearby opponents are affected by Pyro, Hydro, Electro, or Cryo, she will quietly attune her Purr-loined Treasure Flask to that element, gradually filling it. When the duration ends or the skill is used again, Jahoda drains the Purr-loined Treasure Flask and deals a single instance of Anemo DMG to nearby opponents. When the Purr-loined Treasure Flask is full, Jahoda immediately drains it, exiting the Shadow Pursuit state and dealing a more powerful instance of Anemo DMG.\nIf her dash fails to make contact with an opponent, Jahoda instead drops a Smoke Bomb at her location, dealing a single instance of Anemo DMG to nearby opponents.\n\nMoonsign: Ascendant Gleam: When the Purr-loined Treasure Flask becomes full, Jahoda will not immediately discharge it. Instead, for a short duration, she steadily consumes the stored element inside and periodically fires Fluffy Meowballs at nearby opponents, dealing DMG of the corresponding element stored in the Purr-loined Treasure Flask. When a Fluffy Meowball hits an opponent, Jahoda regenerates 2 Elemental Energy. This effect can be triggered once every 3.5s.\n\nThere are many ways to divide wealth in this world — but for Nod-Krai's treasure hunters — and hoarders — only one has ever proven sufficiently effective."

Among them, the element with the highest number of characters determines the effect:\n· Pyro: Purr-sonal Household Helper Coordinators deal 130% of their normal damage.\n· Hydro: Purr-sonal Household Helper Coordinators heal for 120% of their normal amount.\n· Electro: The number of Purr-sonal Household Helper Coordinators increases by one.\n· Cryo: The attack interval of Purr-sonal Household Helper Coordinators is reduced by 10%.\n\nIf there's a tie between elements, priority is given in the order: Pyro > Hydro > Electro > Cryo.
